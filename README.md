# File Transfer App

## Overview

File Transfer is a Flutter and Dart-based Android app designed to provide users with the ability to organize and manage their media files easily. The app allows users to create tasks, specifying source and destination directories, enabling automatic transfer of new files from source to destination.

## Background Story

Google Photos, by default, uploads the entire DCIM folder from Android phones to its cloud. This leads to the automatic inclusion of a variety of images, such as Facebook images, screenshots, screen records, Pinterest images, and more. To address the challenge of organizing this diverse set of images, the File Transfer app was created.

The app empowers users to create tasks, defining source (e.g., DCIM) and destination (e.g., CustomDCIM) directories. It automatically moves newly added files from the source directory to the destination, providing users with a way to manually organize and select specific content for further actions, such as uploading to Google Photos.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Create tasks for monitoring specific directories.
- **Automated Transfer:** Automatically move newly added files from the source directory to the destination directory.
- **Manual Sorting:** Enable users to manually organize and select files in the destination directory for further actions, such as uploading to Google Photos.
